# Sveriges Radio Player Web App

---

- [LIVE DEMO](https://harry-yates.github.io/radioPlayer/)

Radio player that plays the R3 channel via Sveriges Radio API.

Previous, current and next songs are displayed in the Neumorphic style UI.

Hyper Island - The First App - Brief 3.

### :open_file_folder: The Brief:

Build a web app built upon Sveriges Radio API.

- Use plain JavaScript.
- Code should be readable.
- Code has to be maintainable.

### :hourglass_flowing_sand: Time spent / Deadline:

1 week.

### :dart: Goals:

- Make use of Sveriges Radio API.
- Create a radio player with a nice UI.
- The app needs to be maintainable as we'll be recreating it in React for the following brief.

### :mechanical_arm: Solution:

I built a small radio player component that is easy to maintain. I was able to achieve this using a simple SASS structure. For this project, I took inspiration from a [Neumorphic Elements](https://codepen.io/myacode/pen/PoqQQNM) Codepen I'd spotted and was keen to adapt.

This project was a chance to push myself with JS, SASS and various APIs. I made use of three apis in this project:

- [Swedish Radio's open API](https://api.sr.se/api/documentation/v2/index.html)
- [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api)
- [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers)

### :anger: Challenges:

The documentation was in Swedish, which made things slightly challenging initially. However, I was able to jump this hurdle reasonably quickly.
