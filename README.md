# Sveriges Radio Player Web App

---

- [LIVE DEMO](https://harry-yates.github.io/radioPlayer/)

Radio player that plays songs via Sveriges Radio API. Previous, current and next songs are displayed in the UI.

Hyper Island - The First App - Brief 3.

### :open_file_folder: The Brief:

Build a web app built upon Sveriges Radio API (though you are more than welcome to use another API if you wish)

- Use plain JavaScript
- Code should be readable
- Code has to be maintainable

### :hourglass_flowing_sand: Time spent / Deadline:

1 week.

### :dart: Goals:

- Make use of Sveriges Radio API.
- Create a radio player with a nice UI.
- App needs to be maintainable as we will be recreating it in React for the next brief.

### :mechanical_arm: Solution:

I built a small radio player component that is easy to maintain. I was able to achieve this by using a simple SASS structure. For this project, I took inspiration from [Neumorphic Elements(https://codepen.io/myacode/pen/PoqQQNM) Codepen I liked.

### :anger: Challenges:

This project was a chance for me to push myself working with JS, SASS and with APIs. I made use of three API's Sveriges Radio API, OpenWeather API and the unsplashi API to bring in music art as part of the interface.

The documentation was in Swedish, which made things slightly challenging initially. However, I was able to jump this hurdle reasonably quickly.
